The below project is a personal project, just to help me see crimes in areas that I'm trying to find housing. Current crime apps only work if the latitude is filled out. However, for person crimes, they don't fill out the lat/long, but only the city. Therefore, I wanted a way to see which areas of Seattle have the most types of crime I'm worried about. 

I utilized the crime API from the Seattle Governement [Seattle.Gov](https://data.seattle.gov/)

## Installation
Installation is not needed, as the entire application is on Heroku. Please use the General Account to login here > https://disaster-list-dashboard.herokuapp.com/Dashboard . (testaccount@gmail.com, GenericPassword12!)


## Usage
Visit the heroku link, login with the test account and look at the crime data, amazon stock price and metals price. In the future I'm going to add in a real estate API to also map the data. 

I'm also going to allow the data to be more customizable. (Search time period and crime type.)
